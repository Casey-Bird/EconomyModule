# EconomyModule
 
This file by no means is the best way to implement the systems that I did. Before I was able to refactor a lot of it, the library (discord.py) was discontinued due to some issues surrounding the Discord bot developers at Discord. This file can show very simple methods to interact with a MySQL database and how it can be better than using something like JSON when considering storing data for a Discord bot.


The idea of the module was to create a fun, interesting game for server members to participate in. Ranging from jobs with unique abilities and skills to fully complex mini-games like hunting, fishing and more.
